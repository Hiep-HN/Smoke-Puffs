Wave your stuffed animals around to stir up winds that carry clouds and a soccer ball with them! Blow the soccer ball into your opponent's goal to score. Tap the screen to remove the game and just play with the clouds. Tap the screen again to bring the game back with the score reset to 0-0.

To play this game, you need:

* an iPad with front-facing camera (only tested on iPad 2)
* something red (like a stuffed red alien)
* something green (like a stuffed Android mascot)

The game works better if you are not wearing any red or green and if there is nothing red or green behind you within view of the front camera.
